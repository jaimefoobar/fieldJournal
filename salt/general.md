## Getting Laid
* Text her after you have sex saying 'I had a great time, we should do this regularly' ... then
 ditch her in a few weeks telling her you found someone else about 
   * I had a really great time, we should get together again next week.
* If she asks you about an arrangement after the first date / sex, say: "We should meet again and
 discuss it, I'm usually particular about these things but this looks promising"
 
 
## Profile
* Get background verified.
* Create a sense of scarcity from the first text. Tell her "Hey, I've got a couple meetings
lined up today but you caught my eye. Tell me more about yourself. Did you have an adventurous
  weekend? I'll try reply when my day opens up."
  * This creates instant scarcity and a sense they need to qualify
* If they view you: "Hey I see you viewed me/favorited me/requested to objectify me without even
saying hello! I didn't take you for the shy type. Tongue Face"  

## Arrangements
* When the issue of arrangements comes up:
  * Tell them you're looking for someone to spoil, someone to take on on vacations with, explore
   chicago, get pampered with, and more. Someone to enjoy your lifestyle with, but that you're
   very particular. Someone who can tag along with you on your adventures.
  * If the come to your place and then ask for money, say
    * I'm looking for a more long-term arrangement that would be far more advantageous than just a
     quick transaction
    * I am not about to pay up front for any arrangement until I know what I'm getting into.
* Shut down any money discussions before and during the first meet and greet.
* Talking about the specifics of an arrangement is a waste of time. Get HER to agree that there
are things money can't buy and you can provide that to her. Again my favorite way of doing this
is to talk about ex relationships. 
* Just treat her bring up money as shit tests for you to blow past

## The Date
* Don't go in text circles with them, they need to know your a busy man and as such your
time is valuable. Send them a few texts, then set a time and date to meet. Some of these girls
will flake because they will want someone who they can know as a friend and will have texted a
while. Text to escalate, set time to meet, if you keep going in circles then stop replying; they
will send you a restart text later or you send them one under the pretense that you got busy or
had a family emergency.
* Tell her you have a second apartment in NY or some other city 
* During the date:
  * Build good rapport
  * Physically escalate
  * Later try and go in for the kiss
  * Make up an excuse for why you have to leave ... "it's a late night and I have to get up
   tomorrow, too bad because I don't want this night to end" ... maybe she will suggest some
   quick drinks at your place.
   
## Psychology   
* Compliance Tests
  * Tell them what to wear at your meets
  * Have her put the condom on you
  * Tell her what to do, tell her how to have sex: 'Ride me like a sex-starved cowgirl'
  * Be the dominant alpha and she is the submissive compliant one.
