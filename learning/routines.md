Not exactly lines but fun ideas.

* When she doesn't text you back:
  * Sara! Did we totally pretend to be a couple for a few days and then ghosted
    eachother? Hahaha <ghost emoji> <tongue emoji>. [next text message] Haha
    not cool. You, me. Drinks this week. Except for tomorrow because the
bachelorette is on.

* When she asks you how many girls you've slept with:
  * Start couting using your fingers, and when you get to 4 or 5, stop and ask
    'Do threesomes count as one or two?"

* When they tell you they're not hooking up or doing one night stands, etc:
  * "Slow down tiger! Who said anything about sex?!" ... talk about how sex is
    for marriage, etc etc.
