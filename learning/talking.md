### First Date / getting to know more

## Setting up a date

* Wear something cute / sexy so we'll match.

## Conversations

* Actively listening.
  * When she tells you about the time she went to Italy, don't think to
    yourself 'How can I make this about me and my experience with Italy?'.
Instead 1. Understand the deeper meaning of what she said, and 2. repeat what
she said to you back to her.
* Once you find out why she's unique, give her a statement of intent. For
  example, if she prides herself on being well read, say something like 'huh,
you're pretty well read ... I find that pretty sexy.'
