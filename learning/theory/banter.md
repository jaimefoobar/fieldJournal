## General

* Instead of trying to talk forever and always finding random things to say, keep talking by 
focusing on the girl and use her as the catalyst for always having something to say.
* If a girl says "what" to your opener, you want to think "what about what I said could have 
triggered a negative response / set her off" and you should probably say something similar but 
tone it down, or avoid the thing that could have had that negative response / was risky.
* Don't oversell it. You don’t have to tell someone about every conquest or how awesome you are or
how much money you have. Try just being you. If she isn’t interested in the first five minutes, 
she probably won't be.

## Filling in the question

* Instead of just asking a question, you cak ask a question and give a little more information 
on top of it., e.g.:
  * "Who are you here with" - sounds judgy ... vs "Who are you here with, is it just you or a 
  bunch of friends" - sounds more casual, it makes the answer a lot easier for her.
  * You can also use this technique to establish a frame. e.g. for logisitcs, you can ask "So, 
  are you're friends protective?" - but that sounds super creepy. ... Instead, you can say 
  something like "So are your friends super protective to the point where if you walk five feet
  away from them they call the cops or do they realize you're an adult and you can make a 
  decision or two on your own in life?" ... thus framing and indicating / nudging her towards
  the right answer you want.

Can I buy you a drink?
Do you come here often?
Would you like to go out sometime?

I need to start thinking like a really great salesperson. After all, I'm selling myself.
Asking yes or no questions is a great way to get shot down before I even get started. When I ask 
a woman a yes or no question, all she has to do is say no.

“Can I buy you a drink?” – No.
“Do you come here often?” – No.
“Would you like to go out sometime?” – No.

But almost every question can be converted into a statement, or at least a question that requires
some thought.

“Can I buy you drink?” – When you’ve finished that, I’d like to have the bartender bring you a
drink. What are you working on?

“Would you like to go out sometime?” – Let’s meet at the Arches Restaurant tomorrow at 8 or I can
pick you up at your place. Which is best for you?

“Do you come here often?” – It’s a lot more crowded in here than it usually is.

The key is to engage a woman in conversation, and not give her a simple way out of coversation 
with a stranger. Remember: as nervous as you are talking to a strange woman, she is just as 
nervous talking to you. Especially made worse by the fact that most nights out for a woman is 
having to put up a defense and deal with guys trying to get laid. You're offering her that 
relief of talking to a guy that will actually be fun to talk to for once!

One of the easiest ways to start a conversation with a woman is the same way you would start a 
conversation with a guy: say something about what is going on around you.

## Focus on effort rather than on talent or success

* Focus on effort rather than talent or success: people make a good first impression by 
communicating the hard work and effort behind their success. Communicating success and talent in 
job interviews or on dates is important but it is just as important to tell the story of the hard
work and effort behind it to create a warmer, positive, more relate-able first impression.

## Shy girls 

If you are talking to a girl who doesn't talk much but her body language shows that she is 
interested, often offering multiple choice questions make it much easier to engage with her.

For example:
* Do you like hot or cold drinks?
* Do you prefer sweet or savory?
* Coffee or chocolate?
* Black or white?
* Up or down?
* ... it doesn't have to be limited to two options.
