## Make her earn it

* When you meet a girl instead of just trying to impress her, try to make her impress you as well.
If she doesn’t meet your standards don’t be afraid to cut her loose.
* As soon as there is no more suspense for the girl, as soon as she knows she "has" you (she has 
your interest), then sleeping with you is no longer a win. Dating you is no longer a win. 
Returning your call and getting you on the phone is no longer a win. It doesn't give her any 
validation so she is much much less likely to do it. When the girl is unsure, when the girl 
thinks you're higher value, when the girl thinks you have a lot of options, then in that 
situation it is a win for her. She's likely to follow up. She's likely to chase. 
* Talk to hot girls as if they are fat and ugly and you don't wanna impress them

* I realized is that whenever I try to stay very close to them, touch them randomly, keep strong eye
contact, get closer, they stay there. However, when I pull away and switch to pure platonic talk,
they get bored and quickly leave saying "It was nice to meet you".

## Escalating & Disqualifying

* Generally, when you are escalating, it is a good principal to disqualify and escalate at the 
same time because it makes the escalation seem less of a big deal. Disqualifying softens the 
escalation because it seems that the escalation is not so forceful and not so direct. It also 
takes attention off of the escalation because the attention is more likely to be on the level 
of validation then on whatever happened physically. This can be used for physical, verbal, and 
logistical escalation.
* For example:
  * I have to go in a minute (disqualify - false time constraint) ... give her a hug or touch her 
  (physically escalate)
  * "I'm not so sure about you" / "I don't like you" / "I can't believe you said that" 
  (verbally disqualify) ... as you're escalating
