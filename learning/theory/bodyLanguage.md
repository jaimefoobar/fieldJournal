## Confidence

Why be subtle when approaching women? Especially in nightclubs. What are you trying to hide? 
* Make sure your voice is loud.
* Don't sound friendly.
* Sound authoritative.
* Hold direct eye contact.

## The angles

* Approach from the side. If the direction the girl is facing is 12 o’clock, approach from about 2
 to 4 o’clock (or 8 to 10 on the other side).
 * Why not the front? Because a direct approach appears as confrontational and will make her 
 defensive. Also it can create the awkward situation of her seeing you and there still being 20 
 feet to cover.
 * Why not the back? Because it's creepy and if she's in a group, you don't want her to turn her 
 back on her friends. This will make her feel awkward and her friends are going to feel the need 
 to immediately get her back from you. You want to isolate her later, not during the approach.
 
## How to get their attention

* Eye contact. Talking. These are easy and obvious ones, but if you're coming in from the side 
and she doesn't turn to face you when her proximity alarm goes off, all you need is a light and 
brief touch on the shoulder and say "excuse me".
