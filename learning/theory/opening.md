## Set size

* Don't spend too much time trying to select the right target, just open all sets!
* That said, either a 1 set or a 3 set is ideal. A 3 set is good because you'll eventually want 
to isolate the girl from her friends, and if she's there with only one other person, she won't 
abandon that friend. If she's with two friends though, they can keep each other company.
 
## Mixed sets

* A lot of guys get hung up trying to find a girl not talking to a guy, but what they don't know 
is that about 60% of the time they're not involved. It's more often a friend / orbiter, a 
relative, or some other dude at the bar trying to pick her up. There's no harm in finding out.

## Who in the set to open?

* Typically you don't want to open your target. By talking to her friend first, you disqualify 
yourself. Once you've disqualified yourself to her, she is no longer actively trying to reject 
you. Instead she'll begin to try and get your attention and qualify herself to you.
* Opening the friend also helps to disarm obstacles. The less attractive girl is often a buzzkill
and will try to cockblock. But if you approach her instead, she's no longer feeling jealous of 
the more attractive friend, and won't be as much of a problem.
* If there are guys in the group, open them. Again, this is obstacle removal. By approaching the 
guy you want to implicitly acknowledge him as the alpha of the group. He's less likely to try and
AMOG you if he doesn't perceive you as a threat to his social situation. This doesn't make you a
beta though. You're just the alpha of your group, visiting his group.
