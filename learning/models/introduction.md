* We are either the first or second generation for men to grow up without a clear definition of 
what our social roles are supposed to be, and without a model of what it is to be strong and 
attractive men.
* The goal of this book: to provide a model of what a strong and attractive man is (in today's 
society).
* Rampant drunken sex is fun, but not very fulfilling. And it will affect other areas of your 
life in an unhealthy manner.
* Until you have learned to trust your own actions and learned to pursue women with your own 
unique style and personality, you have learned absolutely nothing.
* "What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say" - Emmerson
  - I can say all the right words, but people, and girls in particular, will ultimately me by my 
  actions.
  
* There are two movements:
1. Be attractive, powerful and in control of your relationships with women and with your life in 
general.
2. My failures with women happen because I grew up emotionally ill-equipped to deal with women 
and intimacy. The words I say, the actions I take and the looks I haec are merely a die effect of
that.
  - This is about intellectually learning the behaviours that will cause my emotions to shift, 
  which will then lead to permanent and unconscious changes to transform me into the attractive 
  male I can be.
