## True Confidence
* How attractive a man is is proportional to his true confidence. The more true confidence he 
has, the more attractive he will appear to women.
* Again, women judge a man's status by his behaviour, and this behaviour is referred to as his 
true confidence.
* True confidence infiltrates all behaviours and defines and resonates everything you say and do.
* True confidence = being less invested in other people's perceptions of you than your perception
 of yourself.
* A lack of true confidence causes people to chronically seek validation and approval from others
 since they don't get it from themselves.
* The way to build true confidence and therefore to become more attractive is to invest more in 
myself. 

## Investing in myself
* Women are generally only attracted to men who are less invested in them and are more invested 
in themselves.
* If a man is attracted to a woman, then he should be affected by her and attracted to her - but 
never more than she is by him. The minute he lets her dominate him emotionally, he demonstrates a
 lack of true confidence and a lack of status. He's no longer dependable and loses his ability to
  make her feel secure.
  - Never let a woman dominate you emotionally!
  - Don't highly invest into the women you meet. You don't know them! Be content with my life and
   proud of who I am. If a woman doesn't appreciate that, then Im' better off without her.
  - Am I content with my life and proud of who I am? 
* Have a strong sense of identity and be unwilling to compromise on that.  
* Female sexual attraction is largely based on feeling comfortable and secure in a man that she 
meets -> security & connection.

## Seduction
* Seduction = the process by which a man induces a woman to become as invested in him as he is in
 her.
* A man who is highly invested with low confidence before sex indicates that he's emotionally 
unreliable.
* A man who is confident around sex, displays true confidence, and still demonstrates the desire 
for the woman he's with makes her feel secure.
* There are two ways for seduction to occur:
  1. Boy gives girl the impression that he is less invested in her than himself.
    - This kind of advice is based on performance, how to perform better, how to perform as someone
     who is more attractive would. This usually works for only a short period of time.
  2. Boy demonstrates that he is *actually* less invested in her than he is in himself.
    - This is passive. Based on my own satisfaction with myself, and not from others.
    
## My personal identity and investment
* **Don't let my personal life slip away just because I start dating a girl and become invested in 
her.**
* It's important to invest in oneself even as life changes occur and the relationship goes on. 
It's the only long-term solution to keep long-term relationships stable and happy.
 - After showing a girl less investment in her than in myself, and then after the sex / 
 relationship occurs, don't suddenly become more desperately invested in the girl and lose my 
 identity.
    
## Transforming myself    
* When a man has spent his entire life being unconfident and highly invested, doing the legitimate
 work to transform himself into a confident, attractive man is not easy. To develop true 
 confidence, a man must develop:
   - self-respect
   - a healthy sense of boundaries
   - social competence
   - healthy life habits
* It's often a painful, long-term process that entails quite a bit of introspection, questioning,
 doubt, anger, frustration, personal development, lifestyle changes, and so on.   
 
## False Confidence vs True Confidence 
* There's a difference between not being invested in other people's perceptions of you and not 
caring about them at all. Do not act like you're more important than everyone else and do not 
treat people like shit.  Just don't care / be invested in what they think about you.
* False Confidence = 
  - Focus on your own wants and desires to the point of imposing them onto others.
  - Exaggerate your dominence and boost your strength.
  - Accept no wrongdoing. Admit no faults. Blame others for your problems.
  - Go out of your way to make others feel smaller so that you appear bigger.
* A man of true confidence doesn't try to be in control but rather gives up control. He 
understands that the world isn't about him and that all he can control is himself and his own 
actions. He's not bothered when things don't go his way or when people don't recognize him as 
being amazing because he already feels amazing himself. He doesn't need their approval and their 
disapproval doesn't phase him from his mission. He doesn't need to overcompensate.

## Other
* The key to true confidence is to have both respect for oneself and respect for women.
* A rich man doesn't need to prove to people he's rich. A confidence man doesn't need to prove 
he's confident. A guy who "doesn't give a fuck" doesn't need to go around telling people that he 
doesn't give a fuck. A true alpha male doesn't need to assert his alphaness at every turn.
* A confident woman who doesn't define herself by the man she dates is not going to have time for
 a guy who spends his time trying to impress her.
