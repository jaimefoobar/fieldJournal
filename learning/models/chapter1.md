* The one trait that all women find attractive is social status.
  * Women want men who are more successful, popular, and powerful than they are.
  * It is unclear, however, how exactly women perceive power and status. It varies widely.
* Women judge a man's social status by his behaviour, not by his bank account.  
  * A man of status doesn't need to make out or grab a woman on the first few dates because he is
   of status and doesn't need it.
* Women are attracted to men that they believe have the potential to be extreemely successful.   
* As a man, you don't have to actually be rich and famous, you just have to show a lot of 
potential for being rich and famous and be considered extreemely attractive, or display 
behaviours that imply being rich and famous.
* Social status is determined by:
  1. How you behave around others -> treat others well
  2. How other people behave around you -> be treated well by others
  3. How you treat yourself -> treat yourself well
* Social status is relative. It's about perception. It's determined by behaviour, not assets.
* Women desire to be desired. They desire to be pursued. This ignites a physical arousal.
* The more physical assertiveness you pursue a woman with, the more aroused she becomes, 
sometimes even if she isn't interested in you in the first place. The bold and aggressive pursuit
 of her often turns her on to the point where she comes around and wants to get to know you.
