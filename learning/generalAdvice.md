## I. Attitude

* Stop expecting so much of yourself and other people. Expect nothing and you’ll never be
disappointed.
* Don’t compare yourself to others, there’s always going to be a guy who’s better with girls than 
you. Not even he gets to be with every girl he wants.
* Rejection, ghosting, and failure are part of the game. Instead of moping and getting all worked 
up about it, grow a thick skin to it and pick yourself up afterward and keep going.

## II. Banter and Conversation

* Good game should appear to just happen.
* Game is emotional, not logical.
* Don't talk about game in game.
* Change her mood, not her mind.
* Be direct and straight up about what you want instead of beating around the bush. You’ll find 
out if she’s into you or not sooner rather than later, and that means you can move onto the next
one more quickly.
* Girls get bored when sexual tension is missing.
* Escalate while disqualifying
* Repeat her name back to her.

## III. How to Learn

* Do you notice any patterns? Is there a common denominator in the girls you are dating? More 
importantly are you doing the same thing over and over again? If it isn’t working, try doing
something different.


## IV. Opening

* Just freaking open. Don't try to make it perfect, just try to make it happen. Above all else, 
don't sit around on the net all day trying to come up with the perfect opener. Get out in the 
field, open sets, get blown out, and open more.
* Frankly, it doesn't really matter that much what you say in the beginning, most people can't 
remember the opening a few minutes later anyways.
* If you see a girl who catches your eye just talk to her, you never know what will happen.

## V. Relationships

* Why are you acting like she’s the last girl who will ever give you a chance? There’s always 
going to be another girl.
* If you want to be her friend don’t try to date her. If you want to date her don’t try to be her 
friend. Girls don’t put you in the friendzone, you put yourself there. There is a difference between
wanting to sleep with a female friend and preferring not to sleep with a female friend.
* Do NOT get one-itis! If you are young, you should not think that the girl is your world, or
put her on a pedestal. A relationship that does not work out does not mean it is the end of the
world. Keep an abundance mind frame!

## VI. Shit Tests

* If a girl gives you a shit test, repeating it back as a question will often mean you won't have
to pass her shit test because it put the impitous on her to justify the shittest instead. e.g.
"I don't think you're my type" ... "I'm not your type??"
* Don't try to explain your way out of a shit test.
* Don't escalate off of shit tests or off of negatives.

## VII. The Process

* Stop thinking you HAVE to get laid to have a good time or be successful. Success comes first, 
then come the good times, girls come last.
* You’ll get laid, but trust me when I say it’s not the silver bullet that will magically solve 
all your problems.
* Stop worrying about the end-goal and trying to do everything right to achieve it. Just focus on 
casually navigating the process itself and take it as it comes.

## VIII. Wings

* Wingmen are great, but wing-women are even better! I learned this by accident, and wish someone 
would have told me this a long time ago. Be nice to women that you do not find attractive.
When I say nice, I mean literally treat them like they are your sister. Spend time with them,
hang out with them, and invite them to group occassions. But make sure they don't catch feelings.
Similar to what women do, make it evident that they are in the friendzone with you.
These women will talk you up to their girlfriends and hook you up constantly! You can even point
out women you find attractive and they will open the girls, talk you up, and introduce you!
Instant social validation! My wing-women friends are my secret weapon.
