### Three things I did well:
1. For the first time in my life, I went to a bar, met a girl, and took her home.
2. I did a good job with push / pulls. When talking to girls, I would tell her she seems cute but
dorky, or that I wasn't so sure about her but now she seems interesting now that I know she went
to college in Scotland.
3. I escalated and passed shit tests. The girl at first seemed like she didn't want to make out
with me. But I continued to be patient, work the set, game her, and push against her resistence.

### Three things to improve upon:
1. I once told the girl that if she wanted to know my last name that she would have to earn it.
This kind of evaluation is too obvious.
2. My openers weren't always the greatest with the most personality behind them. I would just go
up to a girl and say that I like her dress and would come across as some boring person she
wouldn't want to talk to. I need to act like a person who already knows them.
3. I talked to a girl who was pretty mean and wasn't getting the greatest vibe from her. But when
I ditched her she seemed shocked. I guess she was giving me more shit tests than I thought and
that they weren't always signs of disinterest. This was also a sign of being a bad wingman as
one friend was gaming the other set, and although he left for a moment, he wanted to back and
close her.
