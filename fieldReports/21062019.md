## Summary:

It's Friday afternoon and everyone is chatting on our group messenger that none of them can 
really go out tonight, but tomorrow, Saturday, should be a big day of lot's of day game and night
game. I think to myself that this is a good thing. I am going to go out tonight by myself. It's 
going to be difficult, but going out by yourself can really help you learn the most.

John texts me at 7:45pm that he actually might be able to come out tonight and asks what the plan
is. I'm actually a bit disappointed he wants to join to be honest. I wanted to go out solo, not 
tell anyone, not try to ask for motivation. I just wanted to see if I can do it on my own. Don't 
get me wrong, I'm really happy that I went out with John as you'll find out. And I know that he's
reading this, so I don't want him to think that I'm a dick or anything. I guess my goal in 
writing this is just to try and be honest at all times with how I feel, and maybe others can 
relate. It's more important to me to be a good friend to John than getting laid.

I hate waiting. It's horrible. Once 5pm hits, it's all nervous anticipation that's worse 
than being out there in the actual field. Will it go well? What if I completely bomb? It's the 
same reason why we're afraid of the dark - we don't know what's there.

I try to take a nap after getting home. At around 8pm I still feel a bit stressed out. I go on my
computer and start coding. It helps distract me a bit ... Hopefully by now you figured out that 
I'm a developer simply by the fact that I'm hosting these field reports on github. If you didn't
figure that out, fyi, github is essentially a place where developers save all their lines of code.

I have IBS and my stomach is just churning with stress. If you don't know, doctors and 
psychologists often refer to something as the 'gut - brain' connection. When you're really 
stressed out, your stomach can react to those feelings and get stressed out itself. Sometimes at 
times stomach issues can trigger anxiety as well.

My stomach feels like it's lighting up. At times it feels super cramped and I've had some 
diarrhetic symptoms. Should I bail on John? He'll hate me if I do. What if my stomach is just 
tramautically uncomfortable and I have to go to the bathroom in some shitty bar with a toilet 
that doesn't have a stall door?

Again, I'm not going to bail on John. That would be a shitty thing to do. hehe, pun. I will 
admit, I have gone through some actual tramautic medical issues with my IBS. I know that sounds 
weird. If you don't know about IBS much, then maybe you think I shit and fat a lot. It's a lot 
more complicated than that. All to say, going out tonight also forces me to face those fears as 
well, of my IBS symptoms. This is also why I didn't have a drink of alcohol tonight. And I still 
had fun. Ultimately, I know in the back of my head, I just have to push myself ahead, just walk
forward into the night, and I'll be fine.
