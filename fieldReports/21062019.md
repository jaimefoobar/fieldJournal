## Summary:

It's Friday afternoon and everyone is chatting on our group messenger that none of them can 
really go out tonight, but tomorrow, Saturday, should be a big day of lot's of day game and night
game. I think to myself that this is a good thing. I am going to go out tonight by myself. It's 
going to be difficult, but going out by yourself can really help you learn the most.

John texts me at 7:45pm that he actually might be able to come out tonight and asks what the plan
is. I'm actually a bit disappointed he wants to join to be honest. I wanted to go out solo, not 
tell anyone, not try to ask for motivation. I just wanted to see if I can do it on my own. Don't 
get me wrong, I'm really happy that I went out with John as you'll find out. And I know that he's
reading this, so I don't want him to think that I'm a dick or anything. I guess my goal in 
writing this is just to try and be honest at all times with how I feel, and maybe others can 
relate. It's more important to me to be a good friend to John than getting laid.

I hate waiting. It's horrible. Once 5pm hits, it's all nervous anticipation that's worse 
than being out there in the actual field. Will it go well? What if I completely bomb? It's the 
same reason why we're afraid of the dark - we don't know what's there.

I try to take a nap after getting home. At around 8pm I still feel a bit stressed out. I go on my
computer and start coding. It helps distract me a bit ... Hopefully by now you figured out that 
I'm a developer simply by the fact that I'm hosting these field reports on github. If you didn't
figure that out, fyi, github is essentially a place where developers save all their lines of code.

I have IBS and my stomach is just churning with stress. If you don't know, doctors and 
psychologists often refer to something as the 'gut - brain' connection. When you're really 
stressed out, your stomach can react to those feelings and get stressed out itself. Sometimes at 
times stomach issues can trigger anxiety as well.

My stomach feels like it's lighting up. At times it feels super cramped and I've had some 
diarrhetic symptoms. Should I bail on John? He'll hate me if I do. What if my stomach is just 
tramautically uncomfortable and I have to go to the bathroom in some shitty bar with a toilet 
that doesn't have a stall door?

Again, I'm not going to bail on John. That would be a shitty thing to do. hehe, pun. I will 
admit, I have gone through some actual tramautic medical issues with my IBS. I know that sounds 
weird. If you don't know about IBS much, then maybe you think I shit and fat a lot. It's a lot 
more complicated than that. All to say, going out tonight also forces me to face those fears as 
well, of my IBS symptoms. This is also why I didn't have a drink of alcohol tonight. And I still 
had fun. Ultimately, I know in the back of my head, I just have to push myself ahead, just walk
forward into the night, and I'll be fine.

I was listening to the Real Time with Bill Maher on my phone (they release the show as a podcast)
at 3am while playing Candy Crush because I have awful sleeping habits. One thing Bill Maher 
discussed with his panelists was why young people are having less sex. They discussed a number of
issues, how men are afraid that women they have consensual sex with will later change their mind 
about it being consensual (see Aziz Ansari). The availability of porn. How, if young women are 
being taught in school that if men are full of toxic masculinity that needs to be cured, then 
what is your dating life going to look like if you think the men you are dating are oppressing you
and are the patriarchy?

Obviously times are a bit more complicated now. There are a lot of bad things about the SJW 
movement. I'm thankful for the #meToo movement because it has brought a voice to women that has 
been very much needed and helped them share their perspective. And I believe we should try to 
treat women with respect.

But prince charmings dont grow on trees. Sometimes when you try to flirt with a girl, she may 
think you are creepy. And then 30 minutes later, when you try to flit in the same way with 
another girl, she may think you're the hottest guy out there. I get it, some guys are weird. But 
if you want a man, and a man who knows how to treat you well and make you feel loved ... well, he
can't learn that by sitting on the couch all day. Guys and girls need to get out there in the 
real world and flirt with each other and find out what they want. If you are waiting for a man to
suddenly appear and know how to treat you the exact way you want to be treated, then I just don't
think it's practical. Often, learning social skills takes work and failures, and we can't get 
upset at people for trying to learn those skills. Just, you know, don't be a dick, and if a girl 
doesn't want to talk to you, then move on.

John and I went to Wrigleyville. We both haven't been there before for night game so we spent 
most of the night exploring different spots.

We started off at Sluggers. I had been there many times before, but not on a weekend night. A lot
of cliques, and crappy white girl music with a dance floor. It's loud. And I'm just completely 
cold. I have no idea what to do. The thought of approaching a girl or a group of girls just seems
out of my mind and super intimidating. I'm realizing how impressed with myself I am about 
previous nights I've had. And how did I ever think I could come here by myself and do this? If I 
maybe get six shitty approaches I'll be happy.

Also, I feel completely useless and I hate this. I barely know how to open. If I get interest 
from a girl, I know how to flirt a little and improvise, but I really don't know what I'm doing 
and kinda just pretend. I feel like I'm wasting my time being here. My first 4-5 sets are the 
same. I say hi and something stupid and walk away. I don't know what I'm doing. I should be home 
studying. I think I'm forming bad habits.

A couple of the first few approaches I tell girls they have funny white girl dance moves. They 
look at me like a dick. I get blown out.

---

After going to Sluggers and a loud country bar (for the record, I didn't really like any of the 
music tonight, what is up with you Wrigleyville), we head across the street to a place called 
Deuces. We're waiting in line and these two young Asian girls are complaining about this red 
little puddle next to them. I tell them "That's aids, I should know, I have it." We move up ten 
feet. There's a blue puddle. "Oh, that's herpres." John chimes in. "If you want we can give you
some." Asian girls ask is it free? Me: "No, but there's a 20% discount right now on all std's". 
Asian girl: "Wow, that sounds like a great deal!". John: "Ya, there's actually a buy one get one 
free right now." We flirt with the Asian girls a little more. They are with their guy friends. 
John and I go to the dance floor.

A white girl and her friend are coming down the stairs. The white girl runs into John and spills 
her clear drink onto John. John and I immediately try to work this situation. Her not so 
attractive friend immediately puts her hands on me. I'm not interested.

This white girl is hot. Curves, but good gives. She has really cool hair. Black tube top. Big 
boobs. She knows how to move her hips really well. The problem is she knows that she's really hot.
I'm not going to get anywhere with her by treating her like every other guy does. She just wants 
attention. I often turn my back to her while dancing and just try to enjoy the night. At one 
point I say she needs to watch out, she's going to keep bumping into people. That pisses her off 
and she gives me the finger. I need to figure out how to diss a girl in a more playful way.

Also, I need to learn how to dance. I feel like if I have some decent, cool footwork to break out
onto the dance floor, girls would be excited by that and want to dance with me. A lot of white 
girls out there are on the dance floor and just want to have fun. I don't think I saw any white 
guys with any cool dance moves. If I can be a little decent, I think girls will say "there's a 
guy I can have fun dancing with".

---

John and I leave Deuces. We see if there is anything north but don't find anything. As we walk 
along I peer into a fast food joint and see a cute girl lock eyes with me. I walk ahead but then 
immediately walk back and get another look at her. She looks at me like "What kind of creep are 
you?"

I used to be a high school math teacher. I remember one particular day, as a first year 
teacher, I was just getting bullied a lot by this teenagers. They were really dicks. I 
remember one kid, let's call him Greg (honestly don't remember his name), asked "Why the hell 
would I ever need to know any of this stuff?"

Well, I could get into a rant about why Math is important in life. I guess Greg was complaining 
more specifically why 'Chapter 11' in his Math textbook will every be important to him. First of 
all, shut the fuck up Greg. Second of all, geometry. Because sometimes, geometry often dictates 
which girl, the hot one or the fatter one, is gonna suck your dick that night.

John and I are walking around. I remember googling once 'Best places to get laid in Chicago' and 
one spot in Wrigleyville came up. What was that spot? I eventually found it. It was Smart Bar (we
didn't end up going, it was a $20 cover charge and John is a med student). But another spot that 
was on the list was the Irish Oak.

As John and I are walking around, we peer into this bar with a bunch of people sitting down and 
say let's take a look. I realize this is the Irish Oak.

There are two girls in the middle of the bar dancing with each other. Now, here's where the 
geometry comes into factor. John was on my left as we entered the bar. I approach these two girls.
I just go up to them and say hi. There's a girl on the left, let's call her Gabriel. Girl on the 
right, let's call her Amanda. So I'm on the left directly facing Gabriel and John is directly 
facing Amanda. I tell Gabriel hi. She says "WHAT?". "Hey, how are you? I'm tryint to introduce 
myself, I'm trying to be polite." I say this with a bit of wit and sarcasm. Amanda puts out her 
hand like a princess. I make fun of her for her hand gesture. I try to be more direct with Amanda.
She is definitely much hotter. Her body, her boobs, her but is a 9. Her face is a 7.5. She is 
great. But goddamnit Greg, geometry! John is on my right, it's easier for him to talk to her. 
Take one for the team, I talk to Gabriel.

Know, I can see everything John is doing. He immediately starts talking to Amanda. He pulls her 
close. I find out he says a few flirty things and says something like "Are you adventurous?
Show me." They start immediately making out. He dances with her. Spins her. Spoons her and has 
his hands all over her tits.

As this is beginning I'm talking to Gabriel. "How do you know your friend". I'm thinking to 
myself `oh crap, don't look over to your friend too much, she is totally making out with John 
right now, will this be a problem?`. She answers the question. "Oh so you guys work together?" 
`damnit she's gonna keep noticing her friend is making out with John`. By now she has her hands 
all over me. She's from Guatamela. She's sexy, but she is overweight. Not crazy fat, but not my 
type. But I'm sure she knows how to fuck. I start bringing her close to me. We start making out. 
I think I started making out with her about 45 seconds - 1 minute after I said hi. That was quick.

At one point I'm making out with Gabriel and talking to her. Her hands are all over me. Amanda's
are all over John. It's only been 5 minutes but it seems like it's been hours. We are just four 
people standing here at a bar wasting time because we are all going to fuck each other. I try to 
ask and see how dtf Gabriel is right now. "Do you want me to take you?". G: "What?" J: "Do you 
want me to take you?". G: "What?" `okay, maybe i should not being saying this. Maybe it's too 
forward and upfront?` J: "Do you want me to keep kissing you?". I proceed to make out with her 
more. She's not the greatest kisser. I doubt I am either.

John and I are making out with these girls, dancing, spinning them around, hands on their asses 
and tits. Gabriel's hands are on my chest. I think girls like placing their hands on my chest. 
I'm almost 6'3" and decently work out. Especially if they are shorter, they like feeling a tall 
strong guy.

Amanda has hoop earrings. So does Gabriel. One of Amanda's earings gets caught on 
John's jean jacket. They get in untangled. About three minutes later, Gabriel says 'oh my gosh'
and realizes that one of hers is missing. Suddenly the momentum feels dead, and we are looking 
for it. After about 30 seconds we can't find it. The girls proceed to go to the bathroom.

Ok, this is interesting. What happened? We're totally fucking these girls right? John and I talk.
Let's move them to a different bar, then we'll bring them back to my place (John is living with 
some roomates who seem to be having a get together, and I have a 2 bedroom apartment, so 
enough room for the four of us). The girls eventually come back from the bathroom. We say hey, 
let's go to another bar. The girls follow us outside. John asks them if they like to play Mario 
Kart (I have an N64 at home. Some guys try to bring girls home with the allure of wine or cute 
dogs. My allure is nostalgic video games). Amanda says to John, though I can't totally hear, that
they are going somewhere else. John says "Ok, are you guys sure?" A: "Ya."
 
Maybe what I said to Gabriel about 'wanting to take her' was too much and freaked her out / 
started to scare her. Maybe when they got to the bathroom they kinda got scared of their sluttiness.
Maybe we got cockblocked by hoop earrings.
